/**
 *  Module 11 assignment: KD-Trees
 *  2d-tree implementation.
 *  uses a 2d-tree to implement the same API (but replace PointSET with KdTree).
 *  A 2d-tree is a generalization of a BST to two-dimensional keys. The idea is to build a BST with points in the nodes,
 *  using the x- and y-coordinates of the points as keys in strictly alternating sequence.*/
